## Project Proposal 
*1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use
React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in
becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this
project.*
- React for the front end.
- Express for the backend.
- PostgreSQL to store user database
  
*2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?*
- I will make an evenly focused full-stack application.
  
*3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?*
- It will be a website.
  
*4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?*
- Create a movie discovery and review website that allows users to browse, search, and review movies. Users can explore a diverse collection of films, view details, and engage in discussions about their favorite movies.
  
*5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?*
- Any users who love to watch movies can access my website.
  
*6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create
your own API.*
- Utilize the TMDb API to access a vast collection of movie data, including details, images, and trailers.
  
*7. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:*
# *a. What does your database schema look like?*

# *b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially*
important if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces
notoriously messy data.
# *c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?*
- User authentication 
# *d. What functionality will your app include?*
- Allow users to register, log in, and set up their profiles.
- Build a comprehensive movie library with information about various films.
- Implement a search and filtering functionality for users to discover movies.
- Create dedicated pages for each movie, displaying details such as title, genre, cast, director, synopsis, and release date.
- Embed movie trailers using platforms like YouTube
# *e. What will the user flow look like?*
- Users start to register or login to the website
- select trending movies or search movies by name.
- Users can add a movie to their list to watch later.
- Users can read reviews of any movie from other users and state a review or reply to others.
- Users can click the play button to watch the trailer of the movie.
- Users can click to logout button to leave the website.
# *f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch goals?*
- User Authentication and Profiles:
+ Allow users to create accounts, log in, and have personalized profiles.
+ Implement role-based access control to differentiate between regular users and administrators.

- Advanced Search and Filters:
+ Implement advanced search capabilities with filters and sorting options to help users find specific content.

- Rich Text Editing Uploads:
+ Allow users to create content with rich text formatting
